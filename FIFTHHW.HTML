                <h2>Facts about Cats</h2>
                <p>
                    Cats are known to sleep for an average of 12 to 16 hours a day, with some resting even longer.
This behavior is not a sign of laziness but rather a natural adaptation inherited from their wild ancestors, who conserved energy between short, intense bursts of activity while hunting.
When a cat chooses to sleep near or beside a human, it reflects a deep sense of trust and security; they are most vulnerable when asleep, so sharing that time with someone is a quiet gesture of affection.
Their rest is not merely physicalâ€”it is part of their emotional rhythm, and being part of it is a privilege we often underestimate.

            <aside>Meowing is a vocal behavior cats use mainly to communicate with humans rather than other cats.
It serves to express their needs and emotions, with each cat developing unique sounds to capture attention.
This communication highlights the special bond and adaptability cats have in interacting with people.
